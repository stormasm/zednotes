We are looking at gpui/src/key_dispatch.rs

```rust
pub fn dispatch_key(
    &mut self,
    keystroke: &Keystroke,
    dispatch_path: &SmallVec<[DispatchNodeId; 32]>,
) -> KeymatchResult {
```

- In the old code its going into the while loop whereas
- In the new code its not going into the while loop...

```rust
println!("context_stack len : {:?}", context_stack.len());
while !context_stack.is_empty() {
    println!("Inside the dispatch_key loop");
```
