Hi everyone, was wondering how I go about using the multi cursor, as I don't see an option for it anywhere besides on the zed website and using the hotkeys it recommends doesnt work for adding a cursor to the next word under my cursor that matches

Option + arrow keys or hold option and click with the mouse on the next work. Works for me tough, and I’m using the default vscode shortcuts.
