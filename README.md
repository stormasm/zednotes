| Key Binding | Action | Command Palette |
| ----------- | ------ | --------------- |
| cmd-shift-n | workspace::NewWindow | workspace: new window
| cmd-o | workspace::Open | workspace: open

#### GoBack and GoForward

```rust
"ctrl--": "pane::GoBack",
"ctrl-shift--": "pane::GoForward",
rg "Go Back"
rg "Go Forward"
```

### Tab Switcher

```rust
"ctrl-tab": "tab_switcher::Toggle",
"ctrl-shift-tab": ["tab_switcher::Toggle", { "select_last": true }],
```

#### Outline Panel & Project Panel

```rust
"cmd-b": "workspace::ToggleLeftDock",
"cmd-shift-b": "outline_panel::ToggleFocus",
"cmd-shift-e": "project_panel::ToggleFocus",
"cmd-shift-o": "outline::Toggle",
```

#### Search buffer symbols

Shift Cmd o

#### Go to a Definition in the Editor for Rust Code

Simply hit the Command key and click

#### Find all references

In order for this to work the Rust Analyzer has to be on...
Simply highlight the "piece of code" you are interested in and then in the Command Palette

```rust
editor: find all references
```

#### how to simulate two instances of zed

iâ€™m doing a lightning talk on zed tonight. does anyone know of an easy way to demo multiplayer coding without another mac? iâ€™m having trouble getting two instances of zed running with separate accounts because of the auto login behavior.

Hi @benfe2003 , the best way is to probably build it from source in release mode, then you can use  script/zed-local -2 to open two Zed instances and start pairing

### when is canvas used and what is it used for ?

The main use case for the canvas is dropping down into an imperative rendering mechanism.  You aren't constrained by the needs of flexbox and UI layout, you're just given a rectangle to draw on using GPUI primitives (Though you still need to describe the area of that rectangle using the wider UI layout mechanisms). I'm not sure what's up with your case though phisch. We use it for stuff like the tiled background on the image viewer, no need to have a whole layout engine just to render that!

### rg

```rust
rg 'impl ModalView for '
```

### Imperative vs Declarative

Declarative would be a ui described by implementing Render or RenderOnce and imperative would be described by implementing Element.

The *declarative* API tries to feel web-like, it gives you a flex layout (just like the CSS flexbox) and lets you think about `<div> analogs` and how they fit together.

The *imperative* API is in terms of rectangles,  pixels etc. It lets you define your own concepts and layout algorithms and tries to stay out of the way.

Implementing a raw text editor is just easier with the imperative API. The layouting is relatively simple (just a line of text) and you can model your cursor as an offset into that line

So, using the imperative API is probably a bit easier ðŸ˜„

##### May 18, 2024

And the story continues

Roughly, yeah!

today Iâ€™d say, any portions of your layout that can be expressed as arrangements of rectangles, you can use divs and the declarative builder

most of the UI in Zed is built this way

when you wanna do something that doesnâ€™t fit that, e.g. a text editor or input element, then you use the imperative API

the builder API is all implemented using the imperative element API, so itâ€™s kind of the lower level of GPUI

### Workspaces

The ProjectPanel only gets loaded once in [zed.rs](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/crates/zed/src/zed.rs).  In other words there is only one of them and it is the *Project Panel* on the left side of the screen.

```rust
cx.spawn(|workspace_handle, mut cx| async move {
    let project_panel = ProjectPanel::load(workspace_handle.clone(), cx.clone());
```

To find out what commands are available in the project panel click on one of the rust files in the project panel and then bring up the command palette and type *project panel*

#### PaneGroup or self.center is the place where the files show up in the workspace

```rust
pub struct Workspace {
    center: PaneGroup
```

Inside the *Render* of workspace.rs

```rust
impl Render for Workspace {
```

```rust
// Panes
 .child(
     div()
         .flex()
         .flex_col()
         .flex_1()
         .overflow_hidden()
         /*
         .child(self.center.render(
             &self.project,
             &self.follower_states,
             self.active_call(),
             &self.active_pane,
             self.zoomed.as_ref(),
             &self.app_state,
             cx,
         ))
         */
         .children(
             self.zoomed_position
                 .ne(&Some(DockPosition::Bottom))
                 .then(|| self.bottom_dock.clone()),
         ),
 )
 // Right Dock
```
