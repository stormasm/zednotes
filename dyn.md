In Rust, dynamic dispatch is a feature that allows the implementation of a trait method to be determined at runtime based on the object's actual type. This is used when the concrete type implementing the trait is not known at compile time. For example, if the compiler doesn't know all the types that might be used with code that uses trait objects, it won't know which method to call. Instead, Rust uses pointers inside the trait object to determine the method to call at runtime.

Dynamic dispatch provides flexibility at runtime, but it's also slightly slower than static dispatch because of the pointer chasing involved in finding the correct function call. It also prevents the compiler from inlining a method's code, which can prevent some optimizations.

To indicate that a trait object will use dynamic dispatch, you can use the dyn keyword before the trait type. For example, dyn MyTrait allows you to work with instances of objects indirectly using dynamic dispatch.
