In programming, observers are objects that receive notifications from a provider, or subject, when a state change occurs. The observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that's useful when:

- Changes to one object's state may require changes to other objects
- The set of objects is unknown or changes dynamically
- Some objects need to observe others for a limited time or in specific cases

#### Here's how the observer pattern works:

Subject: The provider or observable, which maintains a list of its dependents, or observers

Observers: The objects that register with the provider and receive notifications when a state change occurs

Notification: The provider automatically notifies all observers by invoking a delegate

Information: The provider can also provide current state information to observers

The observer pattern is often used in event-driven software to implement distributed event-handling systems. For example, in an auction, the auctioneer is the subject and the bidders are the observers. The auctioneer observes when a paddle is raised, which changes the bid price and broadcasts it to all bidders
