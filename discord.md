Yeah, cx.background_executor().spawn(async { 0u8 }) will you give you back a Task<u8>, that you can await to get that 0!

Hi, is it possible to store state on a RenderOnce  "component" or how would be the idiomatic way to handle, for example, a toggleable button with internal state?

The state would need to be stored on a view and passed in. We don‚Äôt support components having their own state, currently
